Hi, Iâ€™m Sumant Mann and I specialize in Web Development. My experience primarily lies with the use of Python and Django (a Python based web framework) as well as a wide-range of tools and technologies. My interest is being a full-stack developer being involved in everything from the overall direction of a project, to gather requirements, analyzing them, checking feasibility, and the actual implementation and deployment. I have experience with Python/Django (1.2 Years), and am currently involved with some projects based on it. I am also comfortable building user interfaces in the front-end using latest tools like Sass, Susy, Semantic-Ui, Gulp.

You can find me on Github at:
